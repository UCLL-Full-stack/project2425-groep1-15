# Project Pitch

With this app we want people to be able to track their progress in Bouldering.
They should be able to log a picture / video of the problem they have completed, additional information like:
- The difficulty of the problem
- The location of the problem
- And some personal Comment about their experience. 

<!-- We want people to be able to like eachother's accomplishments and push each other to progress in the beautiful world of climbing. -->
